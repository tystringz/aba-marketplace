# MEMORANDUM

---

**TO:** His Excellency Dr. Alex Chioma Otti, OFR, Executive Governor of Abia State

**FROM:** Stringz Technologies LLC

**DATE:** February 2026

**RE:** Proposal for a 90-Day Pilot -- Aba Digital Marketplace (madeinaba.net)

---

Your Excellency,

We write to present a ready-to-deploy digital marketplace platform purpose-built for Aba's trading economy. A five-minute video walkthrough accompanies this memo. We respectfully request your consideration of a structured pilot that would make Abia the first Nigerian state to operate a government-backed digital marketplace at scale.

**The Opportunity.** Aba's markets generate an estimated 144 billion naira in annual trade volume, yet virtually none of this commerce is visible online. Across Ariaria International Market alone, over 70,000 shops and 160,000 artisans operate without a digital registry, without e-commerce infrastructure, and almost entirely on cash. Buyers who would purchase Aba-made goods -- across Nigeria and the diaspora -- simply cannot find them. This is a solvable problem.

**What We Have Built.** At our own cost, Stringz Technologies has designed and developed a working prototype of the Aba Digital Marketplace, accessible at madeinaba.net. The platform enables trader onboarding, product listing, buyer discovery, and a real-time government analytics dashboard. Critically, it is built for Aba's traders as they are today: the system operates via WhatsApp, USSD, and web, so traders do not need smartphones or technical literacy to participate. The enclosed video walkthrough demonstrates the full platform in under five minutes.

**The Ask.** We propose a 90-day pilot scoped to a single market zone -- the A-Line section of Ariaria -- with milestone-based funding of 100 million naira, disbursed against verified deliverables:

- **Day 30:** 500 verified traders onboarded, 2,000+ products live on the platform
- **Day 90:** 2,000 verified traders, 10,000+ products, and a live government dashboard reporting trade activity, trader data, and market analytics

Payments would be tied to the achievement of each milestone. If deliverables are not met, remaining funds are not disbursed.

**Why Now.** Three conditions make this the right moment. First, the Phase II reconstruction of the A-Line market creates a natural integration point -- digital infrastructure alongside physical rebuilding. Second, the Government of Abia Digital Agency (GADA) already exists as the institutional home for this initiative. Third, no other Nigerian state has moved on this; Abia has the opportunity to lead. Conservative revenue projections place the platform's potential at 107 to 178 million naira annually within the first two years through listing fees, promotion tools, and transaction services.

**Request.** We respectfully request an audience with Your Excellency or your designated representative to present the platform in detail and discuss pilot terms. We are prepared to begin within 30 days of approval.

We thank Your Excellency for your time and your continued commitment to the economic transformation of Abia State.

Respectfully submitted,

**Stringz Technologies LLC**
